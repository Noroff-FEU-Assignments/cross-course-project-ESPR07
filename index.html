      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

      There are a couple of ways you could ensure that your web page is as
      secure as possible. One way is sanitizing the code by making sure the
      system only accepts the correct formatting. There are tools that can help
      you do this or it can be done manually. You could also make sure that
      authorization and authentication is harder to bypass for example by using
      a third party authenticator like OneLogin, Okta or other similar tools. It
      it also worth making sure that the tool you end up using if authentic and
      well known, this can usually be checked by seeing how many downloads they
      have per week. Another option would be to use Continous
      Deployment(CD)/Continous Integration(CI), it's a automated process
      checking for security holes in your code which can easily happen in a
      developer oversight, some tools for this are GitHub Action, Jenkins,
      Travis CI and Circle CI. Flagged code will be rejected so a developer can
      fix the issue. You could alos make sure the network security is safe
      through making sure it uses proper protocol like HTTPS as opposed to HTTP.
      Lastly it's possible to implement a automatic session timeout to make sure
      pages with private information or credentials are not left unattended for
      too long. To make the most of the security it's smart to create a good
      habit of doing as many security measures as possible.
